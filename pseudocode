The psycic game
guess what letter I am thinking of


- computer randonly generates letter
- user given 10 guesses
- user guesses a letter
- if true,   
            the win is added to the "Wins" row 
            "Your Guesses so far" clears


- if false, 
            "Guesses Left" decreases by 1
            letter is placed in "Your Guesses so far"


- if false and out of guess,
            "Losses" increases by one
            "Your Guesses so far" clears
